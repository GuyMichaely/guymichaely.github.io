        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>I'm building this website to learn css (and some html) from the ground up. I'll be using sites like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started" title="MDN HTML intro">MDN</a> and</p>
        <input type="checkbox" checked></input>
        <p id="hi" some-attribute checked>Did you know that you can list an attribute on an element and it will have a value? if it's something like <code>checked</code> on an <code>input</code> element, then the value will be true. Otherwise, it seems to just be set to <code>''</code></p>
        <p id='single-quote-id'>Did you know you can use single quotes for attribute values? I've never seen that anywhere other than the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started">MDN guide</a> I'm reading.</p>

        <span id="fact-container">
            <h3 >Fact:</h3>
            <ul><li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> is superfluous when an HTTP Content-Type header is supplied, but MDN says to include it anyway. Seems like a good idea if the document is not being served over http.</li></ul>
        </span>

        <p>Japanese example: ご飯が熱い。(tried to use characters that aren't in ISO-8859-1 but modern browsers handle it)</p>
        <p>Search engines use the <code>meta name="description"</code> tag to show a description of the page in search results. That's cool, I didn't know that. For the <code>author</code> meta, that's used by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#adding_an_author_and_description">CMSs according to MDN</a>.</p>
